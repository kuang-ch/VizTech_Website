      <p>To understand this question better, we delved into data from ISO New England which regulates all the energy production in the New England region. Just more than 50% of New England’s energy comes from burning natural gas which accounts for around 70% of the emissions produced in the region. Combined with Refuse (burning landfill material) and Wood, these three sources comprise the majority of emissions produced in New England.
      </p>
      <p>From our exploratory analysis, we found that Nuclear, Hydro, and Wind are the three largest sources of energy which do not directly produce carbon emissions. <i> By hovering over each block in the graph above, you can see how the energy profile of New England has changed since 2018 in terms of energy sources</i>

      <p>Continuing to examine the data we obtained from ISO New England, we used this plot to determine which sources of energy contribute the least emissions while still producing the most energy. <b>Nuclear</b>, <b>Hydro</b>, <b>Solar</b>, and <b>Wind</b> were the highest producing sources with zero carbon emissions. Conversely, <b>Natural Gas</b> which produced just over 50% of New England’s energy also generates more than two-thirds of the grid’s emissions. Other sources of non-renewable energy with significant emissions and minor production are Refuse, Oil, and Wood.

      <p>Let's start by examining the yearly usage of different green energy sources. The line plot highlights key findings and reveals intriguing insights into New England's energy landscape.</p>
        <p>Notable trends in the line plot include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A consistent increase in solar energy usage.</li>
            <li>The substantial contribution of hydro power.</li>
            <li>A relatively stable utilization of wind energy.</li>

      <p>For a more granular view of the data, we turn to the heatmap, which offers a comprehensive overview of green energy usage during the same period.</p>

          <li>The overall increase in green energy usage.</li>
          <li>The dominance of hydro power.</li>
          <li>The noteworthy growth in solar and wind energy.</li>

      <p>As we delve into this data, two pressing questions emerge, prompting the need for further research:</p>

        <ul>

      <p>Interested in how both age and the use of a building affect its energy performance, we looked at 16 buildings across Northeastern campus with varying use as defined by Northeastern’s Institutional Master Plan. A few patterns arose...</p>
      <p>Age clearly was a factor when it came to energy efficiency with newer buildings quite consistently performing better than their older counterparts. For example, Richardson–built in 1938 and has not undergone a major renovation since– uses more than double the electricity per square foot of Ryder which was built more than 20 years before, but underwent a major renovation in 1938.</p>
      <p>Similarly, building use is an important factor to consider when it comes to electricity efficiency. Buildings whose main use was <i>Research</i> used more than double the electricity per square foot than administrative buildings who as a whole, demanded the least amount of electricity.</p>

      <p>With buildings accounting for approximately 70% of Boston’s greenhouse gas emissions, Boston’s <b>Building Emissions Reduction and Disclosure Ordinance (BERDO)</b> set emissions standards for buildings larger than 20,000 square feet. The ultimate goal is to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. However, there are building requirements established by BERDO for 2030 to help buildings stay on track.
      </p>
      <p>Using data from Northeastern’s Sustainability Office, we calculated the emissions of both Electricity use as well as Natural Gas for 13 buildings on campus in the years 2018 and 2022. These emissions were then calculated in terms of square footage in order to compare them to the BERDO requirements established by the city.
      </p>
      <p>This data shows both good news and bad news. Out of the 13 buildings studied, <u>three</u> have already met the 2030 requirements in 2022. However, there is still much work to be done. Large research facilities like Egan, Mugar, and Hurtig have a considerable gap to bridge before 2030. Still, newer research facilities such as Behrakis show that there is a promising blueprint to achieve these emissions goals. Richardson–built in 1938–remains a problematic building in terms of its emissions.
